This is my journal of the design and building process of **AirUSB**.

## 10/4/2025 - Research  

Started working on AirUSB, a wireless USB system using WiFi 7 for high-speed data transfer. Explored hardware options like Raspberry Pi 5 and Orange Pi 5 Ultra, but found mini PCs more cost-effective for my needs. Decided on a simple setup: connect USB devices to a transmitter (mini PC) and use a WiFi 7 USB adapter on the PC, aiming for speeds up to 11 Gbps (allows 2x USB 3.0 and 2x USB 2.0).

Chose 'AirUSB' as the project name and brainstormed other names.

Originally, I wanted to use Wigig, but its limitations and lack of modules led me to focus on WiFi 7. Looked into hardware like Orange Pi 5 Max and Ultra, both has PCIe 3.0 x4 capability, which supports a theoretical max of 31.5 Gbps. However, I realised that SBCs like the Raspberry Pi 5 felt underpowered, while the Orange Pi 5 Ultra seemed overkill (im only aiming for 11Gbps). Mini PCs turned out to be a better balance between cost and performance.

Considered using boards like the Orange Pi 5 Plus or Khadas Edge2, but prices of high-end SBCs made mini PCs more appealing. Mini PCs offer better specs, and fewer add-ons, making them simpler and cheaper overall. The plan is to use WiFi 7 USB adapters for the PC side and customise the setup to avoid extra receiver hardware.

I found [this](https://www.amazon.com/Trycoo-Desktop-Computer-Ethernet-Display/dp/B0FHQ7SZZ4) $100 mini pc, with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, saving me from buying SD cards, power supplys and cables. The single USB-C 3.2x2 port (10gbps) can connect to a WiFi 7 usb adapter.
